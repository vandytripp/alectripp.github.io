Hello, and welcome to my site! I am a PhD candidate at Vanderbily University, and I study political behavior with a substantive focus on immigration attitudes and, more broadly, public opinion. Most of my work has a regional focus on Latin America.

My dissertation explores how and why host populations' attitudes toward immigrants change over time, focusing on Colombia in the midst of the Venezuelan displacement crisis.

I address my research questions with a variety of rigorous empirical methods, including surveys, experiments, and text analyses. I complement these empirical approaches with interviews, focus groups, and content analyses to produce well-rounded research on the politics of immigration. I craft my research with  policy implications in mind, so that it can contribute to improving immigrant integration and reducing xenophobia.
