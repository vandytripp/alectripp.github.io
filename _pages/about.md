Hello, and welcome to my site! I study political behavior with a substantive focus on immigration attitudes and a. Most of my work has a regional focus on Latin America. Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Vanderbilt University. 

I approach migration as both a treatment and outcome. As a treatment, I analyze how migration flows impact municipal budget allocations. As an outcome, I study how regimes can influence attitudes toward immigrants and refugees through media framing. My dissertation is concerned with why regimes might respond to large migration flows with pro-migrant policies and how they can sustain citizen support for said policies.

I address my research questions with a variety of rigorous empirical methods, including both survey and text analyses, as well as experiments. I complement these empirical approaches with interviews, focus groups, and content analyses to produce well-rounded research on the politics of migration. 

I craft my research so that it can speak to policy decisions regarding the best practices of immigrant integration and the reduction of xenophobia within host populations.
