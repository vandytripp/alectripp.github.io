Hello, and welcome to my site! I am a political scientist and migration scholar. Currently, I am a doctoral candidate (ABD) in Political Science at Vanderbilt University. I study political behavior with a substantive focus on immigration attitudes and a regional focus on Latin America.

In particular, I analyze how regimes can mold attitudes toward immigrants and refugees through media framing and budget reallocations. My dissertation is concerned with why regimes might respond to large migration flows with pro-migrant policies and how they can sustain citizen support for said policies.

I address my research questions with a variety of rigorous empirical methods, including survey experiments, natural experiments, and text analysis. I complement these empirics with interviews, focus groups, and content analyses to produce well-rounded research on the politics of migration.
