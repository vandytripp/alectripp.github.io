Hello and welcome to my site! My name is Alec Tripp, and I am a 3rd year PhD student in Political Science at Vanderbilt University. I study comparative politics, and in particular, my research focuses on the dynamics surrounding immigration attitudes and integration at the local level.

My research combines rigorous empirical methods, ranging from survey analysis to causal inference, with fieldwork and other qualitative insights.
