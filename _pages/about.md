Hello, and welcome to my site! My name is Alec Tripp, and I am a 3rd year PhD student in Political Science at Vanderbilt University. I study comparative politics with a regional focus on Latin America. In particular, I focus on the elasticity of immigration attitudes and immigrant integration at the local level.

I combine rigorous empirical methods--including survey analysis, experiments, and causal inference--with fieldwork and other qualitative insights to produce well-rounded research on local responses to immigration.
